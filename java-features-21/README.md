## üöÄ Why Java 21 Matters
Java 21 is the **latest LTS** version and marks a major step forward for modern Java. It finalizes several features introduced in preview since Java 17 and delivers powerful enhancements for **concurrency**, **immutability**, and **pattern matching**.

## ‚≠ê Key Goals
- Finalize modern language features (records, sealed classes, pattern matching)
- Introduce **virtual threads** for scalable concurrency
- Make Java more expressive and concise
- Improve developer productivity and runtime performance
